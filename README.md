# üç´ nus3express

This tool converts files in nus3audio to mp3s.

## I want to use nus3express RIGHT NOW!

Go to <https://github.com/jpfleischer/nus3express/releases>
and launch the exe as administrator.

If you do not have chocolatey already, the program will attempt
to install it for you so that it can install git and ffmpeg with 
chocolatey. This may or may not work.

Using the exe is problematic because Windows Defender does
not like exe's that not many people use. If you are nervous about
viruses, then [why don't you scan the files with VirusTotal?](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/527a53c6bf5ce45073dcc86df74b62b11a4b6ffb86d56d9224e4527be28950ae/detection)

Please note that the exe is automatically generated via the GitHub Workflow,
so it is all open-source and uploaded by the bot. Read the code and you
will see that it is innocuous.

## I would like to compile nus3express on my own.

You need: 
* chocolatey

To know whether you have chocolatey, run Powershell as administrator.

Type the following and press Enter.

```bash
choco --version
```

If it says `The term 'choco' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet...`
then you don't have it. Follow these instructions: https://chocolatey.org/install

Now that you have chocolatey, close and reopen Powershell as administrator,
and install Python and Git:

```bash
choco install python git -y
```

Then, after closing and reopening Powershell as admin, download nus3express.
By the way, it is usually a good idea to copy and paste each line individually.
Copying all the commands at once may lead to unknown behavior.

```bash
# maybe go to your downloads folder?
cd ~/Downloads
git clone https://github.com/jpfleischer/nus3express.git
cd nus3express 
```

Finally, run these commands:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python nus3express.py
```

## I want to update my nus3express!

Assuming you downloaded it to your Downloads folder, as above, do the
following in **Powershell as administrator**:

```bash
cd ~/Downloads
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force nus3express
git clone https://github.com/jpfleischer/nus3express.git
cd nus3express 
pip install -r requirements.txt
python nus3express.py
```
